# Further Steps
Clone the following as distinct directories inside `zsh/`:
1. powerlevel10k
2. zsh-autosuggestions
3. zsh-syntax-highlighting
4. fzf-git.sh (whole repo, not just file)

Also, before messing with nwg-look, install the (deprecated) GTK 3/4 Catppuccin themes with `yay -S catppuccin-gtk-theme-mocha`.
